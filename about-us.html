                        Our business is about family, loyalty, mutual respect and love. We work hard and we play hard.

                        country and want to work with South Africans to make it great. We are incredibly proud to be a

                        Our team includes a group of people who have been with us from the beginning. These people are

                        We do everything ourselves at our factory in Beacon Bay. We accept only the best quality in
                        fabrication and workmanship. We make our own patterns, we do our own cutting and we sew 95% of
                        our range ourselves. A garment does not leave our floor that I have not fitted myself.

                        Founded in 2020 by Michaela Kumm, Michaela's Creations has come a long way from its beginnings
                        in East London. When Michaela first started out, her passion for locally made clothing drove her
                        to do
                        tons of research so that Michaela's Creations can offer you easily accessible, locally made
                        clothing
                        right to your doorstep. We now serve customers all over South Africa, and are thrilled that
                        we're able to
                        turn our passion into our own website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any
                        questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
